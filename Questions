Can you explain when we would use global vs local components?
Streams to track changse in MongoDB
LifeCycleHooks


@Component({
	styleUrls: [“./app1.component.css", “../app.component.css"]
}) can we share css like this from app component?


Do we need to learn any react framework for an interview or just 
create-react-app is enough?
