Can you explain when we would use global vs local components?
Streams to track changse in MongoDB
LifeCycleHooks


@Component({
	styleUrls: [“./app1.component.css", “../app.component.css"]

Do we need to learn any react framework for an interview or just 
create-react-app is enough?

I have been exploring Angular 17 and it does not work on a module based library but 
instead with standalone components.
